# LSPNeovim.jl
This is an attempt to smooth over the interface between [nvim-lsp](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp) and [LanguageServer.jl](https://github.com/julia-vscode/LanguageServer.jl).

Note that this requires at least neovim 0.5.  You can get nightly binaries as a convenient AppImage from [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/nightly/nvim.appimage).
